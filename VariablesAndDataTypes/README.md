## 📦 Variables & Data Types – Quick Recap

### What are Variables?

Variables are containers used to store data in memory.
They allow you to save values and reuse them later in your program.

A variable can store different types of data such as text, numbers, or logical values.

### Data Types in Python

Python supports several built-in data types. In this recap, we focus on:

* **String (`str`)**: Text values (e.g. names, messages)
* **Integer (`int`)**: Whole numbers (e.g. age, count)
* **Float (`float`)**: Decimal numbers (e.g. height, price)
* **Boolean (`bool`)**: Logical values (`True` or `False`)

Understanding data types helps you write correct logic and avoid errors.

### Type Conversion

Type conversion allows you to change a value from one data type to another.
This is commonly used when working with user input, which is always read as a string.

Examples of conversions:

* String → Integer
* Integer → Float
* Number → String

Type conversion is essential for calculations and comparisons.

### String Formatting

String formatting allows you to create dynamic messages by combining text with variables.

It is useful for:

* Displaying personalized messages
* Improving readability of output
* Creating user-friendly programs
