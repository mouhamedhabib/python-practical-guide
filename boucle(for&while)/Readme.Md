## 🔁 Loops in Python – Quick Recap

This section provides a light and practical recap of **loops in Python**, including `for` loops, `while` loops, and how to use `time.sleep()` to add delays (useful for countdown timers).

## ❓ What is a Loop?
A **loop** is a programming structure that repeats a block of code multiple times.

Loops are useful when you want to:
- Repeat actions automatically
- Count up or down
- Process multiple values
- Build timers and interactive programs

## 🔹 For Loop
A `for` loop is used when you know **how many times** you want to repeat something.

### Syntax
```python
for i in range(start, end, step):
    # instructions
